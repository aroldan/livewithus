<h3>What is livewith.us?</h3>
<p>Livewith.us is a web application we're building to let housemates organize and communicate more effectively.</p>

<p>Most of the time, the biggest headaches roommmates have living together are based around one of two things: 
either money or communication. Livewith.us makes both of these things easier -- it gives roommates:</p>

<ul>
	<li>an easy-to-use, simple expense sharing tool to split expenses like bills, rent, dinner, TP, whatever</li>
	<li>threaded discussions about today to help roommates ask and answer those tough questions like
"what's for dinner tonight?" or "who wants to come to the bar?"</li>

<p>Our goal is to get groups of roommates to stop worrying "will I get paid back?" or "I wonder if anyone else wants 
to go out tonight?" so they can do more stuff together, save money, stress out less, and generally live together better.</p>
